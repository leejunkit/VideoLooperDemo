VideoLooperDemo
===============

After seeing the insane amounts of money companies are charging for "professional" video players, I've decided to see how much I can do by leveraging on Apple's excellent AV Foundation framework. 

This example demonstrates the seamless looping of a video clip, suitable for displays on LED walls and such. In the future, I plan to have features such as

- Crossfades between two looping video tracks
- Video on secondary display using the iOS video out while keeping the touch screen for selection and mixing of clips
- Adjustable video speeds
- etc
